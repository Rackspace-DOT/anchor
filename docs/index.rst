Anchor Docs
==================================

Anchor provides an easy way to quickly view your Rackspace cloud server
distribution between host servers. In addition you can use the API to ask
whether the new server that has just been built shares a host with another
of your servers. Providing insight into which of your servers would be affected
if a host server goes down.
