Anchor
========

Anchor provides an easy way to quickly view your Rackspace cloud server distribution between host servers by Data Center.

In addition you can utilize an API to ask whether the new server that has just been built shares a host with another server in your account. This provides insight into which of your server(s) would be affected if a specific host server has an issue causing downtime.

To view the API documentation you can visit https://anchor.readthedocs.org
